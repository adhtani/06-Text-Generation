In addition, retinal is more efficient at exfoliating, contributing to brighter skin and more even tone.Other ingredients: Hyaluronic acid is a favorite for plumping and hydrating, which helps skin appear smoother and more radiant. Safflower oil is an anti-inflammatory ingredient that helps calm irritation and protect skin from damage. The result is more youthful, supple skin.pH of 6.50-8.50.
