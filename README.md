# LSTM Model for Text Generation
  
**Introduction**  

The purpose is to build a text generator that predicts the model by using sequential data. There are numerous benefits of a character-based language model given its ability to handle any words, punctuations, and other structure.
This project uses single layer LSTM model for predicting next character in the text data. Long-short-term memory models or LSTMs are used to solve the problem of short-term memory by using gates that regulate the flow of information. Furthermore, I want to see if this model can be used to automate writing product descriptions for companies. For this project, I scraped 405 product descriptions from one of the top Korean Beauty Reseller websites.
